# How to play:
# This is a single-player game.
# When the page is loaded, you will see a "Start" button and the game area below. The game has 5 rounds, increasing in difficulty each round.
# Click on "Start" to start the game.
# Round one will start immediately. You have 10 seconds to memorize the number of red shapes, blue shapes, circles, and triangles in the game area.
# Afterwards, the shapes disappear, and you will input these numbers. Click the "Submit" button to finalize your answers. 
# Afterwards, you will find out how many points you earned. The number of points earned that round is the number of questions correct times the round number.
# Click the "Next Round" button to immediately start the next round. Each round will have the same rules as the previous one, but will increase the number of shapes



# This game was inspired by trivia games, but instead of using real-world knowlegde, the player memorizes shapes and answers questions 
# It uses HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

# Issues I ran into:
# The game doesn't have a quit button. The player can't exit the game in the middle. Instead, either reload the page or finish the game to restart. The code allows the player to reset the game after finishing it. Adding a quit button would require resetting the necessary values.
