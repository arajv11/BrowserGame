# It uses HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

# Click on "Start" to start the game.
# Round one will start immediately. You will have 10 seconds to memorize the number of red shapes, blue shapes, circles, and triangles in the game area.
# Afterwards, the shapes disappear, and you will input these numbers. Click the "Submit" button to finalize your answers. 
# Afterwards, you will find out how many points you earned. The number of points earned that round is the number of questions correct times the round number.
# Click the "Next Round" button to immediately start the next round. # Each round will have the same rules as the previous one, but will increase the number of shapes
